This is a work-in-progress project.

It is a 3-d visualization tool of human anatomy.  The anatomy is structured
in a hierarchy of components.  Multiple components can be visualized
together.

It uses a Creative Commons-licensed database of the human anatomy
obtainable from:

ftp://ftp.biosciencedbc.jp/archive/bodyparts3d/

It uses OpenGL, FreeGLUT, python3, and a basic collection of python3
dependencies.
